# GAMES API
This is an example of a games api build in fastapi by Eric G.

## Installation
Uv is an extremely fast package manager for Python that will help us limit the packages we install in our projects. This way, we won't have to install all the packages in different workspaces, but instead, we'll install the necessary packages for each workspace to be able to work.

### Installation Instructions:: 
 - Open the terminal or CMD in Python, and to install it, use the following command:

    - Windows: powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    
    - Mac o Linux: curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

### Commands:
`uv sync`: This will synchronize the project's dependencies with the environment.

`uv add`: Add a dependency to the project.

`uv remove`: Remove a dependency from the project.

`uv tree`: View the project's dependency tree.



### Activate the virtual environment:
`.venv/bin/activate`: This command will activate the virtual environment where the packages and Python executions will be installed.


## Execution

`uvicorn src.main:app --reload`: To launch the project, we will use this command.
